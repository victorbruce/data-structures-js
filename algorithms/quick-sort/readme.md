# Quick Sort

Just like merge sort, quick sort is also a "divide and conquer" algorithm. It picks an element as a pivot element and partitions the array around the pivot.

There are several methods of picking a pivot element:

- Always pick the first element
- Always pick the last element
- Pick a random element
- Pick the median

On average Quick Sort has a run time of O(n log n).
