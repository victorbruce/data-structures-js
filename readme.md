# Data Structures and Algorithm

Practicing data structures and algorithm to improve my problem solving skills.

## Project Folder Structure

Each data structure has it's own branch. To access a data structure let's say `linked-list` for example,
you will have to:

1. Navigate to the linked-list branch.
2. Navigate to the folder, data structures. In there, you will see a folder with the same name as the
   branch. In this example, `linked-list`
3. Navigate to that folder and view the code as well as the readme file which explains the data structure.

## Running a code.

**Pre-requisite**:
You should have `nodejs` installed on your machine.

Once you have navigated to the data structure/algorithm of interest, in this example `linked-list`; 

**run the command:** `node name-of-file.js`
